# volume meter that flashes at me

* listens to computer audio input
* Can set custom decibel level of threshold
* When volume goes above threshold, it will flash the screen a horrid red
* Will be adding an optional beep tomorrow

forked from https://github.com/cwilso/volume-meter with some modifcations for my use case
