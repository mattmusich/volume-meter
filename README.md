# volume meter that flashes at me

* listens to computer audio input
* Can set custom decibel level of threshold
* When volume goes above threshold, yellow or red indicator window lights up
* Optional beep/sound indicator plays over default audio out (to be continued)

forked from https://github.com/cwilso/volume-meter with some modifcations for my use case
